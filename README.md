<!--
Developer Notes:
- While developing, comment out the 'image' key from 'example/config.yaml' to make the supervisor build the addon. Remember to re-enable it before pushing changes.
- When merging to the 'main' branch, a new build will be triggered. Ensure the 'version' in 'config.yaml' and the 'CHANGELOG.md' are updated.
- The first build might require setting the image configuration on the GitHub container registry to public and adjusting GitHub Actions permissions (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow > Read & Write).
- Adjust the 'image' key in 'config.yaml' to point to your username.
- The 'slug' key in 'config.yaml' should match the add-on's directory name.
- Update all keys/URLs pointing to the original repository to your fork.
- Share your repository on the Home Assistant forums!
